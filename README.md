## ⚙️ Manual Launch

- Click: Run `Start_WMT_GUI.bat` (or `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "WMT-GUI.ps1"`).
- GUI: Run `Start_WMT_GUI.bat` (launches `WMT-GUI.ps1` elevated, hidden console).
- Keep both the BAT and PS1 in the same folder.

## 📁 Output Files (defaults)

- `Installed_Drivers.txt` (Desktop)
- `System_Info_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`
- `Network_Info_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`
- `Driver_List_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`
- `routing_table_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

- **Needs admin:** Right-click BAT → Run as administrator; ensure UAC prompts appear.
- **Update fetch fails:** Check network; updater will warn and keep your local copy.
- **Registry cleanup safety:** Keys are backed up before deletion; HKLM backup/restore available.
- **MAS is optional:** MAS is fetched from massgrave.dev only after your confirmation; not bundled.
